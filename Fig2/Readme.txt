E_int: Interaction energy
S: Total spin
T: Casimir eigenvalue, related to noninteracting energy in a nonrotating trap
a: number of breathing mode excitations
b: number of center-of-mass guiding center excitation
c: number of center-of-mass cyclotron excitation
LL_index: highest occupied Landau level index
