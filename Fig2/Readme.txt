Data explanation.

States are characterized by the following properties:

M : Total angular momentum in units of \hbar
E_tot: Total energy in units of \hbar\omega 
E_int: Interaction energy in units of \hbar\omega 
S: Total spin in units of \hbar 
T: Casimir eigenvalue, related to noninteracting energy in a nonrotating trap, in units of (\hbar\omega)^2 
a: number of breathing mode excitations
b: number of center-of-mass guiding center excitation
c: number of center-of-mass cyclotron excitation
LL_index: highest occupied Landau level index
